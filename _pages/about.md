I am a Student of Computer Science at [Auburn University](https://auburn.edu) and [Wallace State Community College](https://wallacestate.edu). I am a member of the AI, Ethical Hacking, ACM/IEEE, and Competitive Programming groups.

My research interests are the interplay between quantum computing, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.
