I am currently a DevOps engineer for a major retailer supporting multiple petabyte-scale storage systems and computational infrastructure at scale. My current toolset includes Python, bash, Ansible, and [other tools and languages that you can find here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobcoffee).

I am a Student of Computer Science at [Auburn University](https://auburn.edu) and [Wallace State Community College](https://wallacestate.edu).

I am a member of the ACM club as well as the AI, Ethical Hacking, and Competitive Programming groups.

My research interests are the interplay between large scale distributed systems, cloud computing, and automation. I am also particularly excited about learning the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
